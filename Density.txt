\section{Avalanches and algebra: Multiplication and Addition}

Suppose that there $n$ winter travelers per unit area (square kilometer or square mile, if you like). If there are few-enough parties that they only ever get caught in their own avalanches, you'd expect the avalanche-accident rate to be proportional to the area of the start zones ($A_{start}$) and the skier density:

$$R_{avalanche} \propto A_{start-zones} n $$

With me so far? More skiers, more accidents. More/bigger start zones, more accidents.

What if there are enough parties around that there's a chance that one group could trigger a slide that hits another group?

There are two factors that are important:

1) When there are more parties in an area, they will trigger more avalanches (probability $A_{start-zones} n$, just as before.
2) If the average avalanche sweeps through an area $A_{avalanche}$, the rate at which others parties might be struck by that avalanche is then $A_{avalanche}  n$.

So, the rate of inter-party avalanche accidents ought to go something like 

$$R_{inter-party}\propto $A_{start-zones} A_{avalanche} n^{2} $$. 

\bold{It's $n^{2}$!}  This is the important fact in this essay. Everything that follows is there to argue that the time is approximately now to be concerned about inter-party accidents.

Why am I so concerned with $n^2$? Let's look at the probability that our parties will be involved in an accident of either kind; we just add 'em up:

$$R_{accident} = R_{avalanche} + R_{inter-party}$$

That's:

$$R_{accident} = A_{start-zones}( n + A_{avalanche} n^2 ) $$

or, if you please

$$R_{accident} = A_{start-zones}n( 1 + A_{avalanche} n ) $$

If the skier density, $n$ is small, then $n^2$ is smaller still, just like $(0.1)^2$ is 0.01. If $n$ is larger than 1, though, then $n^2$ rapidly begins to dominate the problem, just as $10^2$ is 100.  Okay, great. But what sets the scale of "1" ? 

The answer is in that last equation: it's the size of the typical avalanche that matters. Once $A_{avalanche} n > 1$, inter-party accidents will dominate. This is a common-sense idea -- once there is, on average, one party per avalanche-area, any triggered avalanche is likely to hit another party.

Intuitively, we know this to be true -- in-bounds slides at ski areas are scary in part because the skier density is so high. It also suggests that inter-party slides are likely to be a larger fraction of accidents involving large avalanches -- another common sense idea.

\section{Numbers}

Enough algebra. Let's see what it all means.

If the typical slide is 15-30 m wide $\times$ 50-100 m track-length, then the typical slide is
