\begin_layout Title
Inter-Party Avalanche Incidents May Increase Quadratically With Skier Density
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Charles Hagedorn
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
We estimate from first principles a common-sense result: When the density
 of backcountry travelers becomes comparable to the size of a day's potential
 avalanches, inter-party avalanche incidents will become a substantial fraction
 of all avalanche incidents.
 Furthermore, this model suggests that the likelihood of inter-party incidents
 is quadratic in the density of travelers â€“ twice as many parties quadruples
 the likelihood.
 The argument is made, with selected North American incidents from 2004-2019,
 that inter-party incidents are a timely concern.
 To spur conversation, we enumerate a variety of untested strategies to
 mitigate inter-party hazard.

 At some density of backcountry travelers, avalanches triggered by one party
 will be likely to strike another.
 This work gives formal voice to this idea and, further, suggests that the
 time when such incidents become frequent is either now or in the near future.
 In Section

Many authors have described, directly[XXXRC cite] and indirectly[XXXRC cite],
 the emerging hazard of inter-party incidents.
 The purpose of this work is to provide a framework within which to discuss
 and estimate the magnitude of the concern, address it directly as a hazard,
 and spur discussion of strategies to reduce the likelihood of future inter-part
y incidents.

\begin_layout Standard
To assess inter-party avalanche incidents as a concern, it is interesting
 and useful to develop a first-principles model for their likelihood.
 The estimation that follows is a simple approach to the problem that is
 likely to require small corrections to yield quantitiative predictions.
 This model has qualitative predictive power, predicting both that the inter-par
ty incident rate is quadratic in party density and that there is a critical
 party-density at which the inter-party incident rate becomes significant.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Astute readers will note that when 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\text{parties}}$
\end_inset

 is small, the analysis may require more detail to avoid a double-count.
 The large 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\text{parties}}$
\end_inset

 analysis still applies when 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{party}}$
\end_inset

 is small, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{party}}^{2}$
\end_inset

 scaling should persist for small 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\text{parties}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This analysis is independent of the definition of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

party
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but for some of the estimates that follow, we loosely define a party as
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

any group, as small as one person, that travels independently
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{party}}=N_{\text{parties}}/A$
\end_inset

 be the party-density.
 If there are few-enough parties that they only ever get caught in their
 own avalanches, one expects the avalanche-incident rate per unit area per
 unit time, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\text{single-party}}$
\end_inset

, to be proportional to the party density:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
r_{\text{single-party}}=r_{0}n_{\text{party}}\label{eq:Single party avalanche rate}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implication is straightforward: More parties, proportionally more incidents.
 We estimate the many factors subsumed into 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}$
\end_inset

 (avalanches per party per unit time) in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What if there are enough parties that there is a chance one group could
 trigger a slide that hits another group?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two important factors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When there are more parties in an area, they will trigger more avalanches
 (rate 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}n_{\text{party}}$
\end_inset

), as before.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the average avalanche that day sweeps through an area 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\text{avalanche}}$
\end_inset

, the number of other parties that will be struck by that avalanche is then
 approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\text{avalanche}}n_{\text{party}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the rate of inter-party avalanche incidents, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\text{interparty}}$
\end_inset

, ought to scale like
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{\text{interparty}}=r_{\text{single-party}}A_{\text{avalanche}}n_{\text{party}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
r_{\text{interparty}}=r_{0}A_{\text{avalanche}}n_{\text{party}}^{2}.\label{eq:Quadratic Scaling}

\series bold
The rate of inter-party incidents should scale like the skier-density

 This is the key observation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{party}}^{2}$
\end_inset

 important? Let's look at the rate that parties will be involved in an incident
 of either kind by summing the rates:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{\text{incident}}=r_{\text{avalanche}}+r_{\text{interparty}}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{\text{incident}}=r_{0}(n_{\text{party}}+A_{\text{avalanche}}n_{\text{party}}^{2})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or, suggestively,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 If

\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{party}}^{2}$
\end_inset

 dominates the problem, just as 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{2}$

 What, then, sets the scale of "1" ?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Combined Single and multi-party accident rate"

\end_inset

 holds the answer: Once 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\text{avalanche}}n_{\text{party}}\gtrsim1$
\end_inset

, inter-party incidents will dominate.
 This makes sense â€“ once there is roughly one party per avalanche-area,
 any triggered avalanche is likely to hit another party.
 This notion is intuitive â€“ in-bounds avalanches at ski areas are scary
 in large part because the skier-density is so high.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We define this critical density as 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{critical}}\equiv1/A_{\text{avalanche}}$
\end_inset

.
 It is of particular utility because it depends 
\bar under
only
\bar default
 on the expected size of a day's avalanches, and not on any other property
 of a day's anticipated instability, including the likelihood of triggering
 a slide.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While it is difficult to predict the overall incident rate, as the determination
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}$
\end_inset

 is uncertain, one can consider the ratio of inter-party incidents to total
 incidents:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{r_{\text{interparty}}}{r_{\text{incident}}}=\frac{A_{\text{avalanche}}n_{\text{party}}^{2}}{n_{\text{party}}+A_{\text{avalanche}}n_{\text{party}}^{2}}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{A_{\text{avalanche }}n_{\text{party}}}+1}\label{eq:RelativeIncidentFraction}

As shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 have an important corollary: If the size or likelihood of a day's avalanches
 is greater, we should expect the rate at which inter-party incidents occur

 If slides are more likely, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}$

 will tend to increase, and if slides are larger,

 As backcountry travelers, larger and more-likely slides will force wary
 travelers to consider larger areas (further uphill) and more places (increased
 number of potential start zones) in the context of inter-party incidents.
 In our model, situations with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\text{avalanche}}n_{\text{party}}\gtrsim1$

 are likely to involve inter-party incidents.
 Indeed, if

Relationship of inter-party incident rate to terrain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the equations alone, one would expect both the incident rate
 and the inter-party incident rates to be relatively low.
 Even in mountainous terrain, start-zones are comparatively small, and much
 of the area is not avalanche terrain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Critically, however, 
\emph on
backcountry travelers
\emph default
 are often concentrated in both start zones and avalanche terrain by the
 desire for quality skiing and the travel-focusing effects of terrain itself.
 Furthermore, limited access points (mountain passes/trailheads) for those
 parties tend to further concentrate those parties into yet higher densities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These concentrated party densities can be large.
 As an example, consider

It is a guess, but the Pacific-Northwestern inter-party avalanche hazard
 may be at its greatest on deep-snow storm-skiing days, when trailbreaking
 is arduous, avalanches are likely, and powder fever is high.
 Arduous trailbreaking may be the most-powerful concentrator of backcountry
 travelers, amplifying the already-powerful magnetism of an extant skintrack.

 In Western Washington State, with a population of thousands of active backcount

\end_inset

, there are approximately nine such popular trailheads: Mount Baker, Stevens
 Pass, Yodelin, Alpental, Commonwealth Basin, Bullion Basin, Paradise, Hurricane
 Ridge, and White Pass.
 As skintracks are forged more-deeply into the morning, they bifurcate,

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Optimal conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 conditions can concentrate parties.
 Mountains and routes offer only certain optimal times for passage.
 In the Cascades, and perhaps everywhere, this can be seen prominently in
 periods of spring/summer skiing; both snowpack and limited access curtail
 skiing at other times.
 There are narrow optimal windows for all of Tahoma/Rainier's Fuhrer Finger,
 the North Face of the Northwest Ridge of Pahto/Adams, and Ulrich's Couloirs
 of Stuart â€“ these are listed for their combination of popularity and constraine
d terrain, where a small summer slide can ravage anyone below.
 Indeed, on April 1, 2019, it was reported
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 that 15 parties attempted, and many bottlenecked, the ski route on the
 Grand Teton.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wintertime weather windows provide perhaps even more temporal concentration,
 as the number of good days for attempting bold routes is slim, perhaps
 only one or two weekends per season.
 Fortunately, for now, the number of skiers attempting bold winter routes
 seems low-enough that inter-party hazard is likely to be a smaller concern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to temporal concentration at the scale of days, safety and ski-quali
ty considerations may also concentrate skiers on shorter durations.
 Springtime daily melt-freeze/corn cycles can constrain safe skiing to time
 intervals measured in hours.
 The arrival of a storm or imminent warming can force travelers to enter
 or cross slopes before hazard increases.
 Finally, the perceived pressure from other people, whether to make the
 first tracks on a slope or, again paradoxically, to cross/descend a slope
 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 the presence of other skiers can make the slope more hazardous, can concentrate
 parties in small areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Reduced visibility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If nearby parties cannot be seen, and the distances between parties are
 greater than that allowed by voice contact, it is impossible to be aware
 of anyone above or below.
 In low-visibility conditions in densely-skied areas, this may drive us
 to avoid skiing or ascending an otherwise-reasonable route simply because
 it may not be possible to verify that the route is free of other travelers.

After an extensive search effort, exceeding 3000 person-hours, the solo-skier's

 The accident location, and the injuries to the skier, were consistent with
 an avalanche-related fatality.
 Subsequent investigation revealed that two parties had triggered avalanches
 uphill of the accident site on the afternoon of the skier's disappearance.
 Furthermore, the first of those avalanches can be regarded as an inter-party
 near miss, as a minute's difference in timing would have seen the second
 party struck by the first.
 NWAC's analysis of the accident does not take a position on whether the
 fatality was caused by an inter-party avalanche â€“ both a third avalanche
 triggered by the soloist or a natural avalanche remain viable hypotheses.

Awareness and Education

\begin_layout Standard
Awareness of the increasing likelihood of inter-party conflict with density
 may, on its own, help to curtail inter-party incidents.
 That is, of course, the intent of this work.
 In places where the density of skiers approaches the critical density,
 the hazard should be discussed and mitigated.
 At least a passing mention of inter-party hazard in avalanche education
 at all levels now seems prudent.

As better understanding of the factors that lead to inter-party avalanche
 incidents becomes understood, it will make sense to bring light to the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The root of inter-party incidents is not the 
\emph on

\emph on
density

.
 Backcountry travelers use a tiny fraction of North American alpine terrain,
 perhaps primarily due to access constraints.
 Following the Kendall Peak accident
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "KendallDecember19"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the author has sharply curtailed trips into densely-skied terrain, choosing
 lesser-known destinations, difficult access, or lower-quality snow in order
 to decrease overhead risk from other parties.
 While this strategy has limits, there are still lonely places with great
 skiing to be found on the map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As advocacy organizations work to expand wintertime access, it may be reasonable
 to add safety to the reasons for improved access.
 Inferring from our estimates, it is natural to encourage party densities
 below one per characteristic-avalanche-size.
 D2 slides are roughly 0.01 km

Travel practices

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Defensive routefinding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like defensive driving, defensive routefinding consists of making choices
 that mitigate the risks that others may pose.
 Careful selection of routes through terrain, and, to a lesser extent, times
 to pass through terrain, can strongly limit the chance that another party's
 avalanche might hit us.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Many ridgelines are not susceptible to slides from above â€“ travelling upon
 such a ridgeline inherently provides substantial protection from any inter-part
y incident.

\begin_layout Itemize
Some routes pass through areas of unavoidable avalanche hazard â€“ there are

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 at Roger's Pass, Source Lake Basin and Mushroom Couloir at Snoqualmie Pass.
 Avoiding those areas during times that 
\emph on

 slides are likely, rather than only when natural slides are likely, will
 limit the risk of an inter-party incident.

) accidents make clear the danger of extended loitering in inter-party-avalanche
 terrain.
 When assessing safe spots, the likelihood of human triggers above must
 be considered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Avalanche incidents of all kinds only happen in avalanche terrain â€“ if avalanche
s are a concern, avoiding avalanche terrain is a sure-fire way to avoid
 avalanche incidents of all kinds, including inter-party incidents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Choosing 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 to travel (down or up) routes at times that we expect others might be ascending
 or descending is also a form of defensive routefinding.
 Anticipating the choices of others and making our own conservative diversion
 or delay in order to limit the risks we might present to others is a mark
 of a conscientious traveler.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Active measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we travel in start zones, we are potential triggers for avalanches.
 In addition to passive measures to ensure that we are not travelling above
 other people, there are small measures we can take to communicate with
 those who might be below.
 Radios (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Radios"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) are the superior method of communication in the backcountry, but are not
 used by everyone, nor are they completely reliable.
 As a simple measure, rock climbers and mountaineers yell 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Rope!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 before tossing down a rappel rope, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 before rappelling (which can dislodge rock), 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes eld

 again, when the rope is pulled (which can generate more rockfall).
 The wording is important, but in the snow world, something akin to

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 could provide warning and an opportunity for communication with those below.
 Similarly, for a group entering constrained terrain from below, it might
 be appropriate to shout (or radio (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

)), 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Entering Couloir!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and make an occasional shout as they ascend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verbal warnings are, of course, antithetical to a low-impact and quiet winter
 day (and may lead to confusion, as shouts are  a sign of an emergency).
 If the rate of inter-party incidents continues to grow, the necessity of
 such measures, and the approximate skier density at which they are appropriate,
 will become self-evident.
 At a crowded crag, it is perhaps more welcome than it is jarring to hear
 a climber yell, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 as they begin an orderly descent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to verbal warnings, making micro-route decisions during ascent
 and descent to maximize the leader's ability to see up/down-slope can increase
 the likelihood of noting a potential inter-party conflict before it becomes

run list
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is a shared enumeration/mapping of regions and ski runs used to facilitate
 discussion and improve adherence to each day's terrain assessment/plan.
 In courses at the Washington Alpine Club, run lists have become an integral
 part of our courses, and our students often refer to them after the course
 is complete.
 A publicly-shared run list can serve as a basis for conditions reporting,
 incident response, and general communication.
 While run lists themselves will not offer any advantage for inter-party
 incidents â€“ they may even serve to concentrate travelers during times of
 higher hazard â€“ a strong basis for communication is bedrock upon which
 many mitigation strategies can be built.

Near the Mount Baker Ski Area, there is a backcountry ski run known as

Blueberry Chutes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is a high-traffic run in avalanche terrain, 1.5
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

km from a parking lot, with a straightforward and comparatively safe alternative
 ascent route that reaches the run at the top.
 It is also possible to ascend the run directly, which is arduous, slow,
 exposed to avalanche hazard, and importantly exposed to skiers dropping
 in from above.
 In addition, those ascending from the bottom sometimes choose to transition
 to downhill skiing mid-slope, spending even longer in a hazardous spot.
 This location has become the site of inter-party conflicts

 Such a location is a prime opportunity for a simple local understanding
 â€“ downhill traffic only in Blueberry Chutes â€“ to be more-formally known.
 While this strategy would have an impact on weaker skiers incapable of
 skiing the steepest top pitch, it also protects those weaker skiers from
 getting clobbered from above.

 The Slot is now routinely skied, even by those who ski before their day-jobs
 in Seattle.
 It is a rare thing to be the first to the Slot's entrance after a storm,
 and it is common to encounter multiple parties at the entrance.
 In the present environment, it is hard to imagine a good reason to ascend
 the Slot in winter.
 The hazard from above is significant.

The Alpental Ski Area sits in a constrained valley, with densely-used ski-tourin

 The area has a relatively-unique policy of limited avalanche control within
 its

 backcountry terrain.
 The slide paths and runouts from that terrain reach the valley bottom.
 Passing beneath the area during times of control work, or traveling beneath
 the lift-accessible backcountry during times of instability is inadvisable.
 Furthermore, the skiers returning to the ski area are often travelling
 fast on the most-tempting skintrack.

One of the principal difficulties in avoiding conflict between disparate
 groups is the simple awareness of the existence and location of other parties.
 If parties leaving a trailhead were to publicly note their number, intended
 destination, and approximate schedule, perhaps akin to filing a flight
 plan, subsequent parties would have the opportunity to know who might be
 ahead, and where.
 Furthermore, if a radio channel were appended, communication with those
 ahead might be possible.

A run board may be more useful in constrained terrain, like The Slot at
 Snoqualmie Pass, where entering parties might note their number and the
 time at which they entered, as a note for those who follow behind.
 In The Slot, the overhead inter-party hazard to descending parties is non-negli
gible.
 The 370
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m-tall couloir has a visibility-obscuring dog-leg about a third of the way
 down.
 Without coordination between parties in the couloir, it is possible for
 a group descending the couloir to be impacted by the actions of a group
 they have never seen.
 A concientious party arriving at the Slot's entrance could, seeing that
 a party had entered the couloir only minutes before, choose to wait a few
 minutes for those below to clear the run.
 The social-network shareability of a photo of a run board atop a popular
 run (#firsttracks ?) might increase the likelihood of its use.

 Both a glance at a map of Bear Creek and the inclusion of two Bear Creek
 accidents in this paper suggest that, for Bear Creek locals, inter-party
 coordination is essential.
 While the majority of the documentation praising the effort has, perhaps
 necessarily, been from the radio manufacturer, community radio channels
 appear to have made a positive difference in promoting coordination between
 parties and speeding rescue efforts.
 Indeed, the court decision

\begin_layout Standard
As skier density increases, it may be necessary for backcountry-specific
 radio manufacturers to add the ability to monitor a community channel and
 an intra-party channel simultaneously, so that intra-party communication
 need not obstruct inter-party communication.
 Such a system could be confusing in the haste of an incident â€“ good radio
 discipline on a party channel is preferable, so long as it remains practical.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have made a first-principles estimation of the scaling of inter-party
 avalanche incidents with party-density and found it to be quadratic.
 Furthermore, we find that inter-party incidents should become a significant
 fraction of avalanche incidents with the localized party density approaches
 one party per avalanche area.
 This result is independent of the day's likelihood of triggering avalanches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We explored a series of North-American avalanche incidents in order to show
 varied ways in which inter-party incidents have occurred.
 Moreover, the party-densities at which these incidents occurred are roughly
 consistent with our model, with many incidents near 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{party}}A_{\text{avalanche}}\sim0.1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We enumerated and discussed a number of possible strategies for mitigating
 inter-party avalanche hazards.
 Improved awareness, spreading our parties out over greater area, travelling
 with others in mind, implementing regional travel standards, and communicating
 more-effectively may all help to limit the number of incidents.

As this work was first drafted in an autumn-2018 Seattle coffee shop, customers
 discussed how their friends encountered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 at a local hiking trailhead.
 This aligns with our experience in recent years, with unprecedented numbers
 of wilderness travelers at every trailhead and the disappearance of lonely
 places in the Cascades.
 Inter-party avalanche incidents are coming, if they have not already arrived.
 It behooves us, individually and as a community, to develop strategies
 to proactively address this emerging hazard.
