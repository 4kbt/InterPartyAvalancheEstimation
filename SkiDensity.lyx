\begin_layout Abstract
We estimate, from first-principles, the rate of inter-party avalanche involvemen
ts.
 The model suggests that the likelihood of inter-party involvements is quadratic
 in the density of parties – twice as many parties quadruples the likelihood.
 The model predicts that when the product of the party-density and the area
 of a day's potential avalanches appraches one, inter-party avalanche involvemen
ts will become a substantial fraction of all avalanche involvements.
 As a corollary, the relative rate of inter-party involvements is expected
 to increase with avalanche size.
 We argue, with selected North American inter-party incidents from 2001-2019,
 that inter-party involvements are a timely concern.
 To spur conversation, we enumerate a variety of strategies that may mitigate
 inter-party hazard.

 about the emerging hazard of inter-party involvements.
 At some density of backcountry travelers, avalanches triggered by one party
 will be likely to strike another.
 This work gives formal voice to this idea and, further, suggests that the
 time when such involvements become frequent is either now or in the near
 future.
 In Section

\begin_layout Standard
To assess inter-party avalanche involvements as a concern, it is useful
 to develop a first-principles model for their likelihood.
 The estimation that follows is a simple approach that is likely to require
 small corrections to yield quantitative predictions.
 This model has qualitative predictive power, predicting both that the inter-par
ty involvement rate is quadratic in party density and that there is a critical
 party-density at which the inter-party involvement rate becomes significant.

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that there are 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\text{parties}}$
\end_inset

 parties of winter travelers in a region of area 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\text{parties}}>1$
\end_inset

.
 This analysis is independent of the definition of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

party
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but for the estimates that follow, we define a party as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

any group, as small as one person, that travels independently
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{party}}=N_{\text{parties}}/A$
\end_inset

 be the party-density.
 Here, we define an avalanche 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

involvement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as an interaction between a party and an avalanche, an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

incident
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as an event in which at least one involvement occurs, and an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

accident
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as an incident that yielded significant injury or death.
 If there are few-enough parties that they are only ever caught in their
 own avalanches, one expects the avalanche-involvement (and incident) rate
 per unit area per unit time, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\text{single-party}}$
\end_inset

, to be proportional to the party density:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
r_{\text{single-party}}=r_{0}n_{\text{party}}\label{eq:Single party avalanche rate}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implication is straightforward: More parties, proportionally more involvemen
ts.
 We estimate the many factors subsumed into 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}$

 (avalanches per party per unit time) in

What if there are enough parties that there is a chance one group could

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two important factors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When there are more parties in an area, they will trigger more avalanches
 (rate 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}n_{\text{party}}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the average avalanche that day sweeps through an area 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\text{avalanche}}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{\text{incident}}=r_{\text{avalanche}}+r_{\text{interparty}}

If the party density,

\begin_inset Formula $(0.1)^{2}$
\end_inset

 is 0.01.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{party}}$
\end_inset

 is larger than 1, though, then 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{party}}^{2}$
\end_inset

 dominates the problem, just as 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{2}$

 is 100.
 What, then, sets the scale of "1" ?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Combined Single and multi-party accident rate"

\end_inset

 holds the answer: Once 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\text{avalanche}}n_{\text{party}}\gtrsim1$
\end_inset

, inter-party involvements will dominate.
 This makes sense – once there is roughly one party per avalanche-area,
 any triggered avalanche is likely to hit another party.
 This notion is intuitive: in-bounds avalanches at ski areas are scary in
 part because the skier-density is so high.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We define this critical density as 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{critical}}\equiv1/A_{\text{avalanche}}$
\end_inset

.
 It is of particular utility because it depends 
\bar under

\bar default
 on the size of a day's avalanches, and not on any other property of a day's
 instability, including the likelihood of triggering a slide.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While it is difficult to predict the absolute involvement rate, as the determina
tion of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}$
\end_inset

 is uncertain, one can consider the ratio of inter-party involvements to
 total involvements:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\frac{r_{\text{interparty}}}{r_{\text{incident}}} & =\frac{A_{\text{avalanche}}n_{\text{party}}^{2}}{n_{\text{party}}+A_{\text{avalanche}}n_{\text{party}}^{2}}\label{eq:RelativeIncidentFraction}\\

As shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 As backcountry travelers, larger and more-likely slides will force wary
 travelers to consider larger areas (further uphill) and more places (increased
 number of potential start zones) in the context of inter-party incidents.
 In our model, incidents with

Looking at the equations alone, one would expect both the incident rate

 Even in mountainous terrain, start-zones are comparatively small, and much

\begin_layout Standard
Critically, however,

 desire for quality skiing and the travel-focusing effects of terrain itself.
 Furthermore, limited access points (mountain passes/trailheads) for those

These concentrated party densities can be large.

It is a guess, but Pacific-Northwestern inter-party avalanche hazard may
 be greatest on deep-snow storm-skiing days, when trail-breaking is arduous,
 avalanches are likely, and powder fever is high.
 Arduous trail-breaking may be the most-powerful concentrator of backcountry

 Mountains and routes offer only certain optimal times for passage.
 In the Cascades, this can be seen prominently in periods of spring/summer

 There are narrow optimal windows for all of Tahoma/Rainier's Fuhrer Finger,
 the North Face of the Northwest Ridge of Pahto/Adams, and Ulrich's Couloir
 of Stuart – these are listed for their combination of popularity and constraine

\begin_layout Standard
Wintertime weather windows provide perhaps even more temporal concentration,
 as the number of good days for attempting bold routes is slim, perhaps
 only one or two weekends per season.
 Fortunately, for now, the number of skiers attempting bold winter routes
 seems low-enough that inter-party hazard is likely to be a sub-dominant
 concern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to temporal concentration at the scale of days, safety and snow-qual
ity considerations may also concentrate parties on shorter durations.
 Springtime daily melt-freeze/corn cycles can constrain safe travel to time
 intervals measured in hours.
 The arrival of a storm or imminent warming can force travelers to enter
 or cross slopes before hazard increases.

 It is surprising that it has been difficult to find formal accident reports

\begin_layout Standard
After an extensive search, exceeding 3000 person-hours, the solo-skier's
 remains were recovered on June 4, 2016.
 The accident location and the injuries to the skier were consistent with
 an avalanche-related fatality.
 Subsequent investigation revealed that two parties had triggered avalanches
 uphill of the accident site on the afternoon of the skier's disappearance.
 Furthermore, the first of those avalanches was an inter-party near miss,
 as a minute's difference in timing would have seen the second party struck
 by the first.
 NWAC's analysis of the accident does not take a position whether the fatality
 was caused by an inter-party avalanche – both a third avalanche triggered
 by the soloist or a natural avalanche remain viable hypotheses.

\begin_layout Standard
It is interesting to look for commonalities among the incidents.
 Two stand out: 1) Where

\end_inset

 can be estimated, 6 of 9 incidents overlapped

 The model is, of course, blind to any propensity for parties to avoid one-anoth

 2) Eleven out of twelve incidents involved slab avalanches.
 Whether this is simple correlation with size/frequency or more meaningful
 must await further study.

\begin_layout Standard
It is unlikely, and perhaps undesirable, that the number of backcountry
 travelers will be reduced.
 Therefore, we must find ways to limit the likelihood of inter-party incidents.
 The following are strategies that may mitigate the risk.
 There are certainly more – these are suggested to organize and catalyze
 discussion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Awareness and Education
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Awareness of the increasing likelihood of inter-party conflict with density
 may, on its own, help to curtail inter-party involvements.
 That is, of course, the intent of this work.
 In places where the density of travelers approaches the critical density,
 the hazard should be discussed and mitigated.
 At least a passing mention of inter-party hazard in avalanche education
 at all levels now seems prudent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As better understanding of the factors that lead to inter-party avalanche
 involvements becomes understood, it will make sense to bring light to the
 hazard in avalanche bulletins.
 A key takeaway for forecasters is the apparent importance of avalanche
 size in determining the likelihood of inter-party involvements, especially
 in situations (
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 persistent weaknesses) where avalanche size alone may not convince travelers
 to stay home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Density reduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The root of inter-party incidents is not the 
\emph on
number
\emph default
 of backcountry travelers, but their 
\emph on
density
\emph default
.
 Backcountry travelers use a tiny fraction of North American alpine terrain,
 perhaps primarily due to access constraints.
 Following the Kendall Peak accident
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "KendallDecember19"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the author has curtailed trips into densely-skied terrain, choosing lesser-kno
wn destinations, difficult access, or lower-quality snow in order to decrease
 overhead risk from other parties.
 While this strategy has limits, lonely places with great skiing still exist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As advocacy organizations work to expand wintertime access, they can add
 safety to the rationale for improved access.
 From our estimates, it is natural to encourage party densities below one
 per characteristic-avalanche-size.
 D2 slides are roughly 0.01 km
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$

 in area.
 D3 slides are roughly 0.1 km
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

 in area
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Hence, encouraging party densities below 10-100 parties/km
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

 would be wise, and ten-times lower (intimated by Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) is prudent.

\begin_layout Subsection
Travel practices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If density cannot be wholly avoided, then we must find ways to limit our
 susceptibility to other parties and the risks we may pose to others.
 We cannot control others' choices, but we can control our own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Defensive routefinding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like defensive driving, defensive routefinding consists of making choices
 that mitigate the risks that others may pose.
 Careful selection of routes through terrain, and, to a lesser extent, times
 to pass through terrain, can strongly limit the chance that another party's
 avalanche might hit us.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Avalanches only happen in avalanche terrain – avoiding avalanche terrain
 is the sure-fire way to avoid avalanche incidents of all kinds, including
 inter-party incidents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Many ridgelines are not susceptible to slides from above – traveling such
 a route provides substantial protection from inter-party hazard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Some routes pass through areas of unavoidable avalanche hazard – there are
 plenty of examples: The Mousetrap
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 at Rogers Pass, Source Lake Basin and Mushroom Couloir at Snoqualmie Pass.
 Avoiding those areas during times that 
\emph on
human-triggered
\emph default
 slides are likely, rather than only when natural slides are likely, will
 limit the risk of an inter-party incident.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Hawkins Mountain (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) and Turbo Hillclimb (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Turbo"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) accidents make clear the danger of extended loitering in inter-party-avalanche
 terrain.
 When assessing safe spots, the likelihood of human triggers above must
 be considered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Choosing 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 to travel (down or up) routes at times that we expect others might be ascending
 or descending is also a form of defensive routefinding.
 Anticipating the choices of others and making our own conservative diversion
 or delay in order to limit the risks we might present to others is a mark
 of a conscientious traveler.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Active measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we travel in start zones, we are potential triggers for avalanches.
 In addition to passive measures to ensure that we are not traveling above
 other people, there are small measures we can take to communicate with
 those who might be below.
 Radios (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Radios"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) are the superior method of communication in the backcountry, but are not
 used by everyone, nor are they completely reliable.
 As a simple measure, rock climbers and mountaineers yell 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Rope!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 before tossing down a rappel rope, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

On Rappel!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 before rappelling (which can dislodge rock), 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Off Rappel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to communicate to those above and below, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Rope
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 again, when the rope is pulled (which can generate more rockfall).
 The wording is important, but in the snow world, something akin to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hello Below!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Skiing!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Clear!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 could provide warning and an opportunity for communication with those below.
 Similarly, for a group entering constrained terrain from below, it might
 be appropriate to shout (or radio (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Radios"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

)), 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Entering Couloir!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and make an occasional shout as they ascend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verbal warnings are, of course, antithetical to a low-impact and quiet winter
 day (and may lead to confusion, as shouts are  a sign of an emergency).
 If the rate of inter-party incidents continues to grow, the necessity of
 such measures, and the approximate skier density at which they are appropriate,
 will become self-evident.
 At a crowded crag, it is perhaps more welcome than it is jarring to hear
 a climber yell, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Rope!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as they begin an orderly descent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to verbal warnings, making micro-route decisions during ascent
 and descent to maximize the leader's ability to see up/down-slope can increase
 the likelihood of noting a potential inter-party conflict before it becomes
 reality.

\begin_layout Standard
In recent years

\end_inset

, the notion of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Run List
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has moved from professional operations discussions into the mainstream.
 A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

run list
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a shared enumeration/mapping of regions and ski runs used to facilitate
 discussion and improve adherence to each day's terrain assessment/plan.
 In courses at the Washington Alpine Club, run lists have become an integral
 part of our courses and our students often refer to them after the course
 is complete.
 A publicly-shared run list can serve as a basis for conditions reporting,
 incident response, and general communication.
 While run lists themselves will not offer any advantage for inter-party
 incidents – they may even serve to concentrate travelers during times of
 higher hazard – a strong basis for communication is bedrock upon which
 many mitigation strategies can be built.

 While IAPs contain a level of detail not needed for backcountry travel,
 the occasional publicized traffic pattern may be of use.
 These may be best described by examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Near the Mount Baker Ski Area, there is a backcountry ski run known as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Blueberry Chutes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is a high-traffic run in avalanche terrain, 1.5
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

km from a parking lot, with a straightforward and comparatively safe alternative
 ascent route that reaches the run at the top.
 It is also possible to ascend the run directly, which is arduous, slow,
 exposed to avalanche hazard, and exposed to skiers dropping in from above.
 In addition, those ascending from the bottom sometimes choose to transition
 to downhill skiing mid-slope, spending even longer in a hazardous spot.
 This location has become the site of inter-party conflicts
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BlueberryBagleyTAY,BlueberryDecemberHop,BlueberrySeattleSkintrack"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and can deliver plenty of consequence
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BlueberryAprilFools,BlueberryAprilFoolsVideo"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Such a location is a prime opportunity for a simple local understanding
 – downhill traffic only in Blueberry Chutes – to be more-formally known.
 While this strategy would have an impact on weaker skiers incapable of
 skiing the steepest top pitch, it also protects those weaker skiers from
 getting clobbered from above.

 as a ski line.
 In 2004, it was sufficiently rarely skied that it still made occasional
 sense
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 to ascend directly up the route for convenience.
 The Slot is now routinely skied, even by those who ski before their day-jobs
 in Seattle.
 It is a rare thing to be the first to the Slot's entrance after a storm,
 and it is common to encounter multiple parties at the entrance.
 In the present environment, it is hard to imagine a good reason to ascend
 the Slot in winter.
 The hazard from above is significant.

 The area has a relatively-unique policy of limited avalanche control within
 its

 backcountry terrain.
 The slide paths and runouts from that terrain reach the valley bottom.
 Passing beneath the area during times of control work, or traveling beneath
 the lift-accessible backcountry during times of instability is inadvisable.
 Furthermore, the skiers returning to the ski area are often traveling fast
 on the most-tempting skintrack.

One of the principal difficulties in avoiding conflict between disparate
 groups is the simple awareness of the existence and location of other parties.
 If parties leaving a trailhead were to note their number, intended destination,
 and approximate schedule, perhaps akin to filing a flight plan, subsequent
 parties would have the opportunity to know who might be ahead, and where.
 Furthermore, if a radio channel were appended, communication with those
 ahead might be possible.

A run board may be more useful in constrained terrain, like The Slot at
 Snoqualmie Pass, where entering parties might note their number and the
 time at which they entered, as a note for those who follow behind.
 The 370
\begin_inset space ~

m-tall couloir has a visibility-obscuring dog-leg about a third of the way
 down.
 Without coordination between parties in the couloir, it is possible for
 a group descending the couloir to be impacted by the actions of a group
 they have never seen.
 A conscientious party arriving at the Slot's entrance could, seeing that
 a party had entered the couloir only minutes before, choose to wait a few
 minutes for those below to clear the run.
 The social-network share-ability of a photo of a run board atop a popular
 run (#firsttracks ?) might increase the likelihood of its use.

 Both a glance at a map of Bear Creek and the inclusion of two Bear Creek

 coordination is essential.
 While the majority of the documentation praising the effort has, perhaps
 necessarily, been from the radio manufacturer, community radio channels
 appear to have made a positive difference in promoting coordination between
 parties and speeding rescue efforts.
 Indeed, the court decision

As party density increases, it may be necessary for backcountry-specific
 radio manufacturers to add the ability to monitor a community channel and
 an intra-party channel simultaneously, so that intra-party communication
 need not obstruct inter-party communication.
 Such a system could be confusing in the haste of an incident – good radio
 discipline on a party channel is preferable, so long as it remains practical.

The model presented in Section

 is general, and should extend to the estimation of rates for other inter-party
 backcountry interactions.
 Krause
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "DougKrauseEmail"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 points out that inter-party rescues may be of similar interest.
 Inter-party rescues and inter-party observations are interesting both for
 understanding the rate at which inter-party rescues occur and as a proxy
 for inter-party involvement rates.
 As the area, 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\text{observation}}$
\end_inset

, over which one party can see or hear an avalanche triggered by another
 party is much larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\text{avalanche}}$
\end_inset

, we should expect the rate at which parties observe avalanches triggered
 by others to be much higher than the rate of inter-party involvements.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\text{observation}}$
\end_inset

 is substituted for 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\text{avalanche}}$
\end_inset

, the mathematics should be the same.
 The model then predicts that the rate of inter-party avalanche observations/res
cues should be roughly 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\text{inter-party observation}}\approx r_{0}A_{\text{observation}}n_{\text{party}}^{2}.$
\end_inset

 As avalanche observations and rescues happen far more often than fatal
 accidents, there may be an opportunity for new research with more-reliable
 statistics.

\begin_layout Section
CONCLUSION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We made a first-principles estimation of the scaling of inter-party avalanche
 involvements with party-density and found it to be quadratic.
 Furthermore, we find that inter-party involvements should become a significant
 fraction of all avalanche involvements when the localized party density
 approaches one party per avalanche area.
 This result is independent of the day's likelihood of triggering avalanches,
 and may have utility for avalanche forecasters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We explored a series of North-American avalanche incidents in order to show
 varied ways in which inter-party involvements have occurred.
 Moreover, the party-densities at which these incidents occurred are roughly
 consistent with the model, with many incidents near 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{party}}A_{\text{avalanche}}\sim0.1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We enumerated and discussed a number of possible strategies for mitigating
 inter-party avalanche hazards.
 Improved awareness, spreading our parties out over greater area, traveling
 with others in mind, implementing regional travel standards, and communicating
 more-effectively may all help to limit the number of involvements.

 This aligns with our experience in recent years, with unprecedented numbers
 of wilderness travelers at every trailhead and the disappearance of lonely
 places in the Cascades.
 Inter-party avalanche involvements are coming, if they have not already
 arrived.
 It behooves us, individually and as a community, to develop strategies
 to proactively address this emerging hazard.
